# Wolfenstein3D

This project is a TypeScript re-write of the original MS-DOS version of _Id Software_'s _Wolfenstein3D_ (1992). I learned quite a bit about the old school raycaster techniques while coding this. I hope you find the code educational and the game fun. ðŸ˜ƒ

It features:

- A 2d raycast engine (no 3d / webgl here!)
- Multiplayer (supports upto 2 players)
- Multithreaded (WebWorkers)
- Powered by the [GamingCanvas](https://gaming-canvas.org) library
